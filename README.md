# Telco Customer Churn Data Science Project

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains the resources and documentation for a data science project focused on predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry. Customer churn is a critical concern for telecom companies, and this project aims to leverage data science techniques to better understand and predict customer behavior.

### Project Structure

The repository is organized into three main folders:

1. **Notebooks**: This folder contains all the Python code bases used in the project. The notebooks provide a step-by-step walkthrough of the data analysis, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation processes.

2. **Reports**: In this folder, you will find project synopses and the PowerPoint presentation summarizing the key findings and insights from the analysis. This documentation is crucial for sharing the project's results with stakeholders.

3. **Data**: The data folder contains all the database sources used in the project. It includes the datasets and any related data files necessary for the analysis.

## Project Details

### Objective

The primary goal of this data science project is to develop a predictive model that can identify customers at risk of churning. By analyzing historical data, we aim to uncover patterns and factors that contribute to customer churn. This insight can help the telecommunications company take proactive measures to retain customers.

### Methodology

We follow a systematic approach to achieve our objective:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant data from various sources within the telecom company, including customer demographics, usage patterns, and customer service interactions.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data quality.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform a comprehensive EDA to gain insights into the dataset. Visualize data patterns, correlations, and identify potential predictors of churn.

4. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.

5. **Model Development**: Build and train machine learning models to predict customer churn. Evaluate and compare different algorithms to select the best-performing model.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Validate the model on a test dataset.

7. **Interpretation**: Interpret the model results to identify the most influential factors affecting churn. Provide actionable recommendations for the telecom company.

### Dependencies
